let oldMemos = self.memos.sorted()

 You can sort any sequence of elements that conform to the Comparable protocol by calling this method. Elements are sorted in ascending order.



extension Memo: Comparable {
    public static func < (lhs: Memo, rhs: Memo) -> Bool {
        lhs.order < rhs.order
    }
}
